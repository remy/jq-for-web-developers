# Variables & functions

Example expression:

```js
.sections[].entries[]? | select(.title | ascii_downcase | contains("reduce"))
```

Finds the jq documentation where the title contains "reduce". It's a bit unwieldy to tinker with, so we can change this to a function.

In JavaScript this would be:

```js
function findEntry(string) {
  const result = [];
  manual.sections.forEach(section => {
    if (section.entries) {
      section.entries.forEach(entry => {
        if (entry.title.toLowerCase().includes(string)) {
          result.push(entry);
        }
      });
    }
  });

  return result
}
```

In jq to make a function, we use the `def` keyword:

```jq
def findEntry(string):
  .sections[]
  .entries[]? |
    select(
      .title |
      ascii_downcase |
      contains(string)
    )
  ;
```

The ending semi-colon `;` is important (unlike JavaScript!) as it tells jq that the function has finished. Now in my expression I can call `findEntry` and it will search for me:

```jq{data-source="#manual"}
def findEntry(string):
  .sections[]
  .entries[]? |
    select(
      .title |
      ascii_downcase |
      contains(string)
    )
  ;

findEntry("reduce")
```

{"headline":"jq Manual (development version)","history":"\n*For released versions, see [jq 1.5](/jq/manual/v1.5),\n[jq 1.4](/jq/manual/v1.4) or [jq 1.3](/jq/manual/v1.3).*\n","body":"\nA jq program is a \"filter\": it takes an input, and produces an\noutput. There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a\nparticular field of an object, or converting a number to a string,\nor various other standard tasks.\n\nFilters can be combined in various ways - you can pipe the output of\none filter into another filter, or collect the output of a filter\ninto an array.\n\nSome filters produce multiple results, for instance there's one that\nproduces all the elements of its input array. Piping that filter\ninto a second runs the second filter for each element of the\narray. Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration\nin other languages are just done by gluing filters together in jq.\n\nIt's important to remember that every filter has an input and an\noutput. Even literals like \"hello\" or 42 are filters - they take an\ninput but always produce the same literal as output. Operations that\ncombine two filters, like addition, generally feed the same input to\nboth and combine the results. So, you can implement an averaging\nfilter as `add / length` - feeding the input array both to the `add`\nfilter and the `length` filter and then performing the division.\n\nBut that's getting ahead of ourselves. :) Let's start with something\nsimpler:\n","manpage_intro":"jq(1) -- Command-line JSON processor\n====================================\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n`jq` [<options>...] <filter> [<files>...]\n\n`jq` can transform JSON in various ways, by selecting, iterating,\nreducing and otherwise mangling JSON documents. For instance,\nrunning the command `jq 'map(.price) | add'` will take an array of\nJSON objects as input and return the sum of their \"price\" fields.\n\n`jq` can accept text input as well, but by default, `jq` reads a\nstream of JSON entities (including numbers and other literals) from\n`stdin`. Whitespace is only needed to separate entities such as 1\nand 2, and true and false.  One or more <files> may be specified, in\nwhich case `jq` will read input from those instead.\n\nThe <options> are described in the [INVOKING JQ] section; they\nmostly concern input and output formatting. The <filter> is written\nin the jq language and specifies how to transform the input\nfile or document.\n\n## FILTERS\n","manpage_epilogue":"## BUGS\n\nPresumably. Report them or discuss them at:\n\n    https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues\n\n## AUTHOR\n\nStephen Dolan `<mu@netsoc.tcd.ie>`\n","sections":[{"title":"Invoking jq","body":"\njq filters run on a stream of JSON data. The input to jq is\nparsed as a sequence of whitespace-separated JSON values which\nare passed through the provided filter one at a time. The\noutput(s) of the filter are written to standard out, again as a\nsequence of whitespace-separated JSON data.\n\nNote: it is important to mind the shell's quoting rules.  As a\ngeneral rule it's best to always quote (with single-quote\ncharacters) the jq program, as too many characters with special\nmeaning to jq are also shell meta-characters.  For example, `jq\n\"foo\"` will fail on most Unix shells because that will be the same\nas `jq foo`, which will generally fail because `foo is not\ndefined`.  When using the Windows command shell (cmd.exe) it's\nbest to use double quotes around your jq program when given on the\ncommand-line (instead of the `-f program-file` option), but then\ndouble-quotes in the jq program need backslash escaping.\n\nYou can affect how jq reads and writes its input and output\nusing some command-line options:\n\n* `--version`:\n\n  Output the jq version and exit with zero.\n\n* `--seq`:\n\n  Use the `application/json-seq` MIME type scheme for separating\n  JSON texts in jq's input and output.  This means that an ASCII\n  RS (record separator) character is printed before each value on\n  output and an ASCII LF (line feed) is printed after every\n  output.  Input JSON texts that fail to parse are ignored (but\n  warned about), discarding all subsequent input until the next\n  RS.  This mode also parses the output of jq without the `--seq`\n  option.\n\n* `--stream`:\n\n  Parse the input in streaming fashion, outputing arrays of path\n  and leaf values (scalars and empty arrays or empty objects).\n  For example, `\"a\"` becomes `[[],\"a\"]`, and `[[],\"a\",[\"b\"]]`\n  becomes `[[0],[]]`, `[[1],\"a\"]`, and `[[1,0],\"b\"]`.\n\n  This is useful for processing very large inputs.  Use this in\n  conjunction with filtering and the `reduce` and `foreach` syntax\n  to reduce large inputs incrementally.\n\n* `--slurp`/`-s`:\n\n  Instead of running the filter for each JSON object in the\n  input, read the entire input stream into a large array and run\n  the filter just once.\n\n* `--raw-input`/`-R`:\n\n  Don't parse the input as JSON. Instead, each line of text is\n  passed to the filter as a string. If combined with `--slurp`,\n  then the entire input is passed to the filter as a single long\n  string.\n\n* `--null-input`/`-n`:\n\n  Don't read any input at all! Instead, the filter is run once\n  using `null` as the input. This is useful when using jq as a\n  simple calculator or to construct JSON data from scratch.\n\n* `--compact-output` / `-c`:\n\n  By default, jq pretty-prints JSON output. Using this option\n  will result in more compact output by instead putting each\n  JSON object on a single line.\n\n* `--tab`:\n\n  Use a tab for each indentation level instead of two spaces.\n\n* `--indent n`:\n\n  Use the given number of spaces (no more than 8) for indentation.\n\n* `--color-output` / `-C` and `--monochrome-output` / `-M`:\n\n  By default, jq outputs colored JSON if writing to a\n  terminal. You can force it to produce color even if writing to\n  a pipe or a file using `-C`, and disable color with `-M`.\n\n  Colors can be configured with the `JQ_COLORS` environment\n  variable (see below).\n\n* `--ascii-output` / `-a`:\n\n  jq usually outputs non-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF-8, even\n  if the input specified them as escape sequences (like\n  \"\\u03bc\"). Using this option, you can force jq to produce pure\n  ASCII output with every non-ASCII character replaced with the\n  equivalent escape sequence.\n\n* `--unbuffered`\n\n  Flush the output after each JSON object is printed (useful if\n  you're piping a slow data source into jq and piping jq's\n  output elsewhere).\n\n* `--sort-keys` / `-S`:\n\n  Output the fields of each object with the keys in sorted order.\n\n* `--raw-output` / `-r`:\n\n  With this option, if the filter's result is a string then it\n  will be written directly to standard output rather than being\n  formatted as a JSON string with quotes. This can be useful for\n  making jq filters talk to non-JSON-based systems.\n\n* `--join-output` / `-j`:\n\n  Like `-r` but jq won't print a newline after each output.\n\n* `-f filename` / `--from-file filename`:\n\n  Read filter from the file rather than from a command line, like\n  awk's -f option. You can also use '#' to make comments.\n\n* `-Ldirectory` / `-L directory`:\n\n  Prepend `directory` to the search list for modules.  If this\n  option is used then no builtin search list is used.  See the\n  section on modules below.\n\n* `-e` / `--exit-status`:\n\n  Sets the exit status of jq to 0 if the last output values was\n  neither `false` nor `null`, 1 if the last output value was\n  either `false` or `null`, or 4 if no valid result was ever\n  produced.  Normally jq exits with 2 if there was any usage\n  problem or system error, 3 if there was a jq program compile\n  error, or 0 if the jq program ran.\n\n  Another way to set the exit status is with the `halt_error`\n  builtin function.\n\n* `--arg name value`:\n\n  This option passes a value to the jq program as a predefined\n  variable. If you run jq with `--arg foo bar`, then `$foo` is\n  available in the program and has the value `\"bar\"`. Note that\n  `value` will be treated as a string, so `--arg foo 123` will\n  bind `$foo` to `\"123\"`.\n\n  Named arguments are also available to the jq program as\n  `$ARGS.named`.\n\n* `--argjson name JSON-text`:\n\n  This option passes a JSON-encoded value to the jq program as a\n  predefined variable. If you run jq with `--argjson foo 123`, then\n  `$foo` is available in the program and has the value `123`.\n\n* `--slurpfile variable-name filename`:\n\n  This option reads all the JSON texts in the named file and binds\n  an array of the parsed JSON values to the given global variable.\n  If you run jq with `--slurpfile foo bar`, then `$foo` is available\n  in the program and has an array whose elements correspond to the\n  texts in the file named `bar`.\n\n* `--rawfile variable-name filename`:\n\n  This option reads in the named file and binds its contents to the given\n  global variable.  If you run jq with `--rawfile foo bar`, then `$foo` is\n  available in the program and has a string whose contents are to the texs\n  in the file named `bar`.\n\n* `--argfile variable-name filename`:\n\n  Do not use.  Use `--slurpfile` instead.\n\n  (This option is like `--slurpfile`, but when the file has just\n  one text, then that is used, else an array of texts is used as\n  in `--slurpfile`.)\n\n* `--args`:\n\n  Remaining arguments are positional string arguments.  These are\n  available to the jq program as `$ARGS.positional[]`.\n\n* `--jsonargs`:\n\n  Remaining arguments are positional JSON text arguments.  These\n  are available to the jq program as `$ARGS.positional[]`.\n\n* `--run-tests [filename]`:\n\n  Runs the tests in the given file or standard input.  This must\n  be the last option given and does not honor all preceding\n  options.  The input consists of comment lines, empty lines, and\n  program lines followed by one input line, as many lines of\n  output as are expected (one per output), and a terminating empty\n  line.  Compilation failure tests start with a line containing\n  only \"%%FAIL\", then a line containing the program to compile,\n  then a line containing an error message to compare to the\n  actual.\n\n  Be warned that this option can change backwards-incompatibly.\n"},{"title":"Basic filters","entries":[{"title":"Identity: `.`","body":"\nThe absolute simplest filter is `.` .

To pass a value to another part\nof the program, you'll need that part of the program to define a\nvariable (as a function parameter, object member, or whatever) in\nwhich to place the data.\n\nIt is also possible to define functions in jq, although this is\nis a feature whose biggest use is defining jq's standard library\n(many jq functions such as `map` and `find` are in fact written\nin jq).\n\njq has reduction operators, which are very powerful but a bit\ntricky.  Again, these are mostly used internally, to define some\nuseful bits of jq's standard library.\n\nIt may not be obvious at first, but jq is all about generators\n(yes, as often found in other languages).  Some utilities are\nprovided to help deal with generators.\n\nSome minimal I/O support (besides reading JSON from standard\ninput, and writing JSON to standard output) is available.\n\nFinally, there is a module/library system.\n","entries":[{"title":"Variable / Symbolic Binding Operator: `... as $identifier | ...`","body":"\nIn jq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual\nplumbing is not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program\nto the next. Many expressions, for instance `a + b`, pass their input\nto two distinct subexpressions (here `a` and `b` are both passed the\nsame input), so variables aren't usually necessary in order to use a\nvalue twice.\n\nFor instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers\nrequires a few variables in most languages - at least one to hold the\narray, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter. In jq, it's\nsimply `add / length` - the `add` expression is given the array and\nproduces its sum, and the `length` expression is given the array and\nproduces its length.\n\nSo, there's generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jq than\ndefining variables. Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jq\nlets you define variables using `expression as $variable`. All\nvariable names start with `$`. Here's a slightly uglier version of the\narray-averaging example:\n\n    length as $array_length | add / $array_length\n\nWe'll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where using\nvariables actually makes our lives easier.\n\n\nSuppose we have an array of blog posts, with \"author\" and \"title\"\nfields, and another object which is used to map author usernames to\nreal names.

If you're\nused to programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby,\nJavascript, etc. then you can think of it as though jq does a full\ndeep copy of every object before it does the assignment (for\nperformance it doesn't actually do that, but that's the general\nidea).\n\nThis means that it's impossible to build circular values in jq\n(such as an array whose first element is itself). This is quite\nintentional, and ensures that anything a jq program can produce\ncan be represented in JSON.\n\nAll the assignment operators in jq have path expressions on the\nleft-hand side (LHS).  The right-hand side (RHS) provides values\nto set to the paths named by the LHS path expressions.\n\nValues in jq are always immutable.  Internally, assignment works\nby using a reduction to compute new, replacement values for `.` that\nhave had all the desired assignments applied to `.`, then\noutputting the modified value.  This might be made clear by this\nexample: `{a:{b:{c:1}}} | (.a.b|=3), .`.  This will output\n`{\"a\":{\"b\":3}}` and `{\"a\":{\"b\":{\"c\":1}}}` because the last\nsub-expression, `.`, sees the original value, not the modified\nvalue.\n\nMost users will want to use modification assignment operators,\nsuch as `|=` or `+=`, rather than `=`.\n\nNote that the LHS of assignment operators refers to a value in\n`.`.  Thus `$var.foo = 1` won't work as expected (`$var.foo` is\nnot a valid or useful path expression in `.`); use `$var | .foo =\n1` instead.\n\nNote too that `.a,.b=0` does not set `.a` and `.b`, but\n`(.a,.b)=0` sets both.\n","entries":[{"title":"Update-assignment: `|=`","body":"This is the \"update\" operator '|='.  It takes a filter on the\nright-hand side and works out the new value for the property\nof `.` being assigned to by running the old value through this\nexpression. For instance, (.foo, .bar) |= .+1 will build an\nobject with the \"foo\" field set to the input's \"foo\" plus 1,\nand the \"bar\" field set to the input's \"bar\" plus 1.\n\nThe left-hand side can be any general path expression; see `path()`.\n\nNote that the left-hand side of '|=' refers to a value in `.`.\nThus `$var.foo |= . + 1` won't work as expected (`$var.foo` is\nnot a valid or useful path expression in `.`); use `$var |\n.foo |= . + 1` instead.\n\nIf the right-hand side outputs no values (i.e., `empty`), then\nthe left-hand side path will be deleted, as with `del(path)`.\n\nIf the right-hand side outputs multiple values, only the first\none will be used (COMPATIBILITY NOTE: in jq 1.5 and earlier\nreleases, it used to be that only the last one was used).\n","examples":[{"program":"(..|select(type==\"boolean\")) |= if . then 1 else 0 end","input":"[true,false,[5,true,[true,[false]],false]]","output":["[1,0,[5,1,[1,[0]],0]]"]}]},{"title":"Arithmetic update-assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=`","body":"\njq has a few operators of the form `a op= b`, which are all\nequivalent to `a |= . op b`.

For example,\n`(.a,.b)=range(2)` outputs `{\"a\":0,\"b\":0}`, then\n`{\"a\":1,\"b\":1}`.  The \"update\" assignment forms (see above) do\nnot do this.\n\nThis example should show the difference between '=' and '|=':\n\nProvide input '{\"a\": {\"b\": 10}, \"b\": 20}' to the programs:\n\n.a = .b\n\n.a |= .b\n\nThe former will set the \"a\" field of the input to the \"b\"\nfield of the input, and produce the output {\"a\": 20, \"b\": 20}.\nThe latter will set the \"a\" field of the input to the \"a\"\nfield's \"b\" field, producing {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 20}.\n\nAnother example of the difference between '=' and '|=':\n\nnull|(.a,.b)=range(3)\n\noutputs '{\"a\":0,\"b\":0}', '{\"a\":1,\"b\":1}', and '{\"a\":2,\"b\":2}',\nwhile\n\nnull|(.a,.b)|=range(3)\n\noutputs just '{\"a\":0,\"b\":0}'.\n"},{"title":"Complex assignments","body":"Lots more things are allowed on the left-hand side of a jq assignment\nthan in most languages. We've already seen simple field accesses on\nthe left hand side, and it's no surprise that array accesses work just\nas well:\n\n    .posts[0].title = \"JQ Manual\"\n\nWhat may come as a surprise is that the expression on the left may\nproduce multiple results, referring to different points in the input\ndocument:\n\n    .posts[].comments |= . + [\"this is great\"]\n\nThat example appends the string \"this is great\" to the \"comments\"\narray of each post in the input (where the input is an object with a\nfield \"posts\" which is an array of posts).\n\nWhen jq encounters an assignment like 'a = b', it records the \"path\"\ntaken to select a part of the input document while executing a. This\npath is then used to find which part of the input to change while\nexecuting the assignment. Any filter may be used on the\nleft-hand side of an equals - whichever paths it selects from the\ninput will be where the assignment is performed.\n\nThis is a very powerful operation. Suppose we wanted to add a comment\nto blog posts, using the same \"blog\" input above. This time, we only\nwant to comment on the posts written by \"stedolan\". We can find those\nposts using the \"select\" function described earlier:\n\n    .posts[] | select(.author == \"stedolan\")\n\nThe paths provided by this operation point to each of the posts that\n\"stedolan\" wrote, and we can comment on each of them in the same way\nthat we did before:\n\n    (.posts[] | select(.author == \"stedolan\") | .comments) |=\n        . + [\"terrible.\"]\n"}]},{"title":"Modules","body":"\njq has a library/module system.
